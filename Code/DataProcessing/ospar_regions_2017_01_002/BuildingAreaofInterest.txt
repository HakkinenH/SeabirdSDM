### META ###
	Data compiled by HHakkinen
	Start Date: 18/01/2021
	End Date:
	As part of Institute of Zoology ZSL project
	"Evidence-based Climate Change Adaptation Practices to safeguard vulnerable species: supporting conservation practitioners, donors and policy makers"

	The following is our definition of our area of interest in NW Europe (aka NE Atlantic), including steps on how to build
### ###



### DATA SOURCES ###

Our definition uses data from the following sources (see DataSources.txt for download links etc):

### OSPAR Regions (provided by OSPAR)
	The marine areas in the NE atlantic, includes the Azores and Greenland (which we need to exclude)
	
### Europe coastline (provided by EEA)
	A detailed very high-resolution map of all coastline in Europe
	
### European countries (provided by EuroStat)
	A high(ish) resolution of all countries in the world (filtered to Europe)
	
### Europe's sea regions and subregions (provided by EEA)
	A high resolution map of all marine areas in Europe, with categories and sub-categories

### Russia's provinces (provided by GADM)
	A high resolution map of Russia's regions and subregions
	
	


### BUILDING A MAP ###


Start with the OSPAR map. Add the Baltic sea area from the sea subregion map.

Find any country that touches the new OSPAR+Baltic shape and add its landmass. 

Remove any island that lies outside of the OSPAR+Baltic area
Remove Greenland.

Crop Russia. Russia borders the OSPAR region but is massive. Use the map of Russia's provinces to add any province that borders the OSPAR region.

Remove the Azores. The greater Azores area is part of a marine region called 'Macronesia'. Using the sea region map, crop the Azores Macronesia 





### SUMMARY ###
This results in our final shape:

The area of interest incorporates the OSPAR region, the Baltic sea and neighbouring countries:
Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom

This includes Svalbard and all other islands within the OSPAR and Baltic region.

In addition the following Russian provinces (oblast) have been added as they border the OSPAR or Baltic region:
Leningrad, Murmansk, Nenets, Arkhangel'sk, City of St. Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Karelia

Greenland is excluded. 


In the upload folder there are two files "OSPARmap_wGreenlandAzores.png" and "OSPARmap_wGreenland.png" 
The first is as described as above

The second is the same except in addition:
The Azores (defined as the Macronesia marine region) is excluded.



Questions: are we happy with how I've defined and cut the Azores?
			Should we crop Greenland in a different way?

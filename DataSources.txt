	As part of Institute of Zoology ZSL project
	"Terrestrial or marine species distribution model - Why not both? A case study with seabirds"


The following is a description of the raw data required to run the SDM code
Since this data does not belong to the authors it is not included in the repository
However underneath we specify how to acquire the data and any processing required

### ###


The "1-Wrappers" R file can be customised to any required file path, but the default assumes you put data in the "InputData" folder


### DEFINED AREA OF INTEREST ###
	The area defined is based on the OSPAR regions, but with some modifications

	### OSPAR Regions
		We limit our area of interest to the OSPAR regions
		This information was downloaded from
		https://odims.ospar.org/layers/geonode:ospar_regions_2017_01_002
		Downloaded 5th Jan 2021

		A useful note: the NE vector lies on the x=51 vector, the NW vector lies on the x=-44 vector
		We modify this to include the Baltic (incorporating the coastlines of Poland, Sweden, Finland and the Baltic states)
		and to exclude Greenland, the Azores, Madeira and the Canaries.

		Some additional useful shapes to help make our map:


	### Europe coastline
		Detailed polyline of Europe's coastline. Useful for plotting and cropping
		Downloaded from https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-coastline-for-analysis-2
		6th Jan 2021


	### European countries 
		Shapefile of all European coastlines at a high resolution. Useful for plotting and cropping
		Downloaded (at 1:1m) from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/countries
		6th Jan 2021

		For some useful notes on the content
		https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/countries/countries-2020-files.html
		Our work uses content from the CNTR_RG_01M_2020_4326.shp folder


	### Europe's sea regions and subregions
		Shape of europe's marine region, with subregions
		Downloaded from https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/europe-seas
		6th Jan 2021

	### Russia provinces
		To add only the coastal provinces of russia we need a shapefile of their outline
		Downloaded from https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html
		21st Jan 2021
	
	### Global coastline
		To calculate the isolation of various islands
		Downloaded from https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/
		27th Jan 2021


	### The final outline shape of the OSPAR region was made with in QGIS
		See methods section of paper. Final shape is provided in InputData as "OSPAR_LandSea.shp"

### BIRDLIFE RANGES ###

	The ESRI geodatabase from BirdLife (provided via FTP request) is contained in a geodatabase
	And is unchanged raw data. It is however massive, because it is ALL species.
	Downloaded: 19th Dec 2020

	The data has been filtered down to the seabird species of interest

	In addition I filtered by the following fields:

	#Presence
		Keep extant (1) range information only
		Exclude probably extant (defunct anyway), possibly extant, possibly extinct, probably extinct, extince, uncertain

	#Origin
		Keep Native, Reintroduced, Introduced, origin uncertain, assisted colonisation (1,2,3,5,6)
		Exclude Vagrant

	#Season
		Keep resident, breeding season, non-breeding season, seasonal occurrence uncertain (1,2,3,5)
		exclude passage

	#Compiler
		For some reason the compiler can be split for a species, these are merged to make it simpler.
		
	
	We convert this to a spatially disaggregated lat/lon file. It takes a polygon and spits out a spatial point dataframe.
	In addition, for species that do not have a clear marine breeding marine range, we use foraging distance to "crop" the total range and ignore points far out to sea that would otherwise be included (see methods).

### ENVIRONMENTAL DATA ###
	### Current
		Terrestrial: WorldClim (V2.1) data https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html
					 WorldClim has a number of variables at various resolutions, and has had recent updates
					 Downloaded from biogeo.ucdavis.edu V2.1 repo 26th Jan 2021
					 
			Currently the main variables are Mean temperature of the warmest month, precipitation during the breeding months, isolation of landmass, area of landmass, distance to sea, mean/min NDVI
		
		Marine: Bio-Oracle data https://www.bio-oracle.org/downloads-to-email.php
				Downloaded 26th Jan 2021
		
				for monthly values I use: http://www.marspec.org/
				Downloaded 25th Jan 2021
				
				Marine values are trickier as there is LOADS of raw data available and trawling through it to get a usable dataset is tricky.
				In addition most of these are at 5min resolution (close to source resolution), not many are interpolated to 30s
				In the absence of a clear 30s dataset I stuck to 5min as high-res information is less important at sea, can resample if needed
				
				Currently the main marine variables are sea surface temperature during the winter/spring, maximum chlorophyll concentration (as sea surface), bathymetry, distance to land
				
		
		Note that for some pieces of work I use SDMpredictors which is just a wrapper to download the above sources
		Anything downloaded through the package is placed in InputData and then processed
		Other raw data is in a folder named after the source (as above)
		
		Note that marine layers are derived from raw data, a comparison of raw data sources can be found here: https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/sst-data-sets-overview-comparison-table

		# Additional note for NDVI 
			A lot of options
			In the end I downloaded MODIS NDVI (as it seems complete and relatively easy to use)
			https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod13.php
			MOD13C2  (V0.006)
			1km Res, 2016-2020 (Mar-Sept) resolution, many layers with raw data.
			
			Trying to download takes you to either a server (which is a pain to use)
			or to the NASA EarthData download portal. However this portal does not actually let you download, it just gives you server links
			
			These links can then be fed to an API, e.g. cmd/python/R. I used R.
